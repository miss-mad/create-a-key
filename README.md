## Description

This is a simple and efficient password generator to help equip you for our password-laden world. In addition to choosing the password length, users can also customize passwords based on character types they wish to include. Powered with JavaScript, users can interact with the webpage multiple times to achieve their ideal password for the account they wish to protect. And it's free! The only trick is that you then have to remember the passwords that you create - but that's for another project.
